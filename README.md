# CleanCV

**Modern, minimal, and modular LaTeX CV template** :sparkles: :page_facing_up:

Many LaTeX CV templates are ugly, hard to use, or both. CleanCV gives you clean design, effortless customization, and advanced features — so you can focus on your research, not formatting.

See the [example cv](assets/example_cv.pdf) or preview the first 2 pages below (*content generated with Claude*):

## Quick Start

1. **[Create your CV instantly in Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/docs?snip_uri=https://github.com/giladturok/CleanCV/archive/main.zip)** — Click to open a new Overleaf project with CleanCV pre-loaded
2. **Replace example content** — Update `main.tex` and `publications.bib` with your information
  
See detailed and step-by-step instructions in [customize.md](customize.md) on how to use the advanced features.

*To set up your own GitHub repository with version control, see the [Create Your Own Repository](#create-your-own-repository) section below.*

## Philosophy

**Goals:** Aesthetic looking, "batteries-included" for popular features, easy to customize (to add your own features)

**Non-Goals:** Implement all possible fancy features (b/c increases complexity)

## Create Your Own Repository

**Want version control?** Create your own GitHub repo instead of just using Overleaf:

1. **Use template** — Click **"Use this template"** button at the top of [CleanCV repository](https://github.com/giladturok/CleanCV) to create your own copy

2. **Edit your files:**
   - **Locally:** Clone and edit with any LaTeX editor
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-cv-repo.git
     # Edit main.tex and publications.bib, then compile
     ```
   - **Overleaf:** Edit in Overleaf by syncing your Github repo to Overleaf [(guide)](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/GitHub_Synchronization) (premium required)
